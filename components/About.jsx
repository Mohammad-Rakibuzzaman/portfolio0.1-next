            As a Full-Stack Developer with a strong background in Python
            (Django) and React, I specialize in building dynamic, AI-powered web
            applications tailored to meet specific client needs. My experience
            spans from developing robust, scalable backend systems to creating
            responsive, intuitive frontends using Next.js and React. With a
            passion for integrating emerging technologies like GPT-based AI
            models, I focus on delivering solutions that not only solve complex
            problems but also enhance user experience. Iâ€™m committed to staying
            up-to-date with the latest trends, ensuring that every project I
            work on is both innovative and reliable.
